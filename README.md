# My First Real World App

This was my first program that has solved the real world issue. I had made it when I was on my vacation after 12th standard. It's made in java and I had made it for my own practice and also for one organization to get their work done faster.

# Lil Bit History
There is an Brahmin Organization which conducts events throughout the year for Brahmin Community at my town. They have around ~2000 members in 2018 ( When I have made this project ).

Issue they are facing: Whenever any event comes, They manually make the invitation covers for all famelies and write name, address, phone number and all that. It takes them a lot of time to do it. So I have made one application in which all the details of family with their family members will be stored in DataBase and then at the time of event, the stickers having name, address, phone number and other details will get printed in matter of hours. 

They used to spend 1 or 2 weeks in this process which now need only 5-6 hours to print and paste it on covers.

# About App
It's an GUI based Java Swing Application, which gives the ability to enter the detatil of family and family members. There are around 45 field per form which will go to database and can be processed later whenever needed.

I have used Java, Swing, MySQL and Some libraries like JCalender, JDateChooser.

### Some Facinating facts for me
It's my first program after I have learnt java and it gone till more then 7000 lines. ( That file is at /src/AZBS.java ) Don't judge me, I have done all things in one place rather then splliting out features in different files cause I'm new to it at that time. But still it's a overwelming task I did as a start of my programming journey.
